Enqueue Operation:

1. Push into stack1:
   To enqueue an element (add an element to the queue), push the element onto stack1.

   plaintext
   Enqueue(1):
   stack1: 1
   

   plaintext
   Enqueue(2):
   stack1: 2  <- top
          1

   plaintext
   Enqueue(3):
   stack1: 3  <- top
          2
          1
  

 Dequeue Operation:

1. Check if stack2 is empty:
 If stack2 is empty, pop all elements from stack1 and push them onto stack2. This step is crucial to reverse the order of elements.

   plaintext
   Dequeue:
   stack1:   <- top
          3
          2
          1

   stack2:

2. Pop from stack2:
   Pop the top element from `stack2`. This will be the element that was added to the queue first.

   plaintext
   Dequeue:
   stack1:   <- top
          3
          2

   stack2: 1  <- top
   

   The element `1` is dequeued.

3. Subsequent Dequeues:
   If you perform more dequeue operations, simply pop from `stack2`.

   plaintext
   Dequeue:
   stack1:   <- top
          3
          2

   stack2:   <- top
   

   The element `2` is dequeued.

 Summary:

- Enqueue: Push elements onto `stack1`.
- Dequeue: If `stack2` is empty, transfer elements from `stack1` to `stack2` to reverse their order. Then, pop from `stack2`.
